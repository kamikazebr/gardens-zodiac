### Getting Started

 * Use Foundry: 
```bash
make install  //or make all
forge install
forge test
```

Check Makefile for more commands.

 * Use Hardhat:
```bash
npm install
npx hardhat test
```

### Features

 * Write / run tests with either Hardhat or Foundry:
```bash
forge test
# or
npx hardhat test
```

 * Use Hardhat's task framework
```bash
npx hardhat example
```

 * Install libraries with Foundry which work with Hardhat.
```bash
forge install rari-capital/solmate # Already in this repo, just an example
```

### Notes

Whenever you install new libraries using Foundry, make sure to update your `remappings.txt` file by running `forge remappings > remappings.txt`. This is required because we use `hardhat-preprocessor` and the `remappings.txt` file to allow Hardhat to resolve libraries you install with Foundry.
